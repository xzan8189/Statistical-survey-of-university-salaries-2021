The purpose of the statistical survey presented in this project is to analyze the data provided by the **UNIVERSITY REPORT 2021** on the annual gross salary of the most important Italian universities according to age.

The goal is to obtain information from which to gain further knowledge and to be able to make considerations on the phenomenon analyzed.

An in-depth analysis on the salary of the Italian population who has graduated from various universities can be very interesting to provide data so that we can broaden these analyzes and make a contribution, based on objective data, to the very important and always current debate on the role of tertiary education in the career path of young people
