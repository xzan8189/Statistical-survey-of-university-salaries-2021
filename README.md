The purpose of the statistical survey presented in this project is to analyze the data provided by the **UNIVERSITY REPORT 2021** on the annual gross salary of the most important Italian universities according to age.

The goal is to obtain information from which to gain further knowledge and to be able to make considerations on the phenomenon analyzed.

Topics covered include:

- Frequency charts and tables for number vectors, matrix columns, and data frames
- Plots for pairs of variables, such as scatterplots
- Frequency distributions and graphs for univariate statistics such as bar, stick and pie charts
- Crosstabs and crosstab graphs
- Graphical representations of data, such as histograms, kernel density plots, and boxplots
- Graphical representations for comparing variables, such as intaglio boxplots, Pareto charts, and function graphs
- Univariate descriptive statistics with R, including indexes of position, dispersion and shape of the frequency distribution
- Bivariate descriptive statistics with R, including sample covariance, sample correlation coefficient, and simple and multiple linear regression
- Cluster analysis, including agglomerative and non-hierarchical (k-means) hierarchical methods
- Continuous random variables with R and continuous probability distributions, in particular the Normal v.c was used
- Point and interval estimation with R
- Hypothesis testing with R, including normal population mean and variance tests and the who-square criterion.

An in-depth analysis on the salary of the Italian population who has graduated from various universities can be very interesting to provide data so that we can broaden these analyzes and make a contribution, based on objective data, to the very important and always current debate on the role of tertiary education in the career path of young people
